## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I focused on core concepts like HTML structure and CSS properties to build and style this project.

I also learned how to modify images inside divs and flexboxes. Ultimately, I chose this project due to its simplicity and also as
a way to practice Git and Github commands.

### Continued development

I would love to build on this project and incorporate Javascript to it, possibly a framework like React as well in the near future.
